The goal of this project is to develop a decentralized application (DApp) that allows users to list and buy items, leveraging Ethereum smart contracts for transaction management. This project will give you hands-on experience with smart contract development, DApp interaction, and Ethereum testnets.

I have used Sepolia Testnet, due to its stability and excellent support for development activities.And MetaMask for ethereum wallet.
